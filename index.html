            In this Data Science and Analytics course, we will discuss advanced
            statistical techniques used in Data Science such as Variance,
            Regression, and Dimension Reduction.
          </p>
          <h5>Analysis of Variance</h5>
          <p>
            Analysis of Variance, also known as ANOVA, is a statistical
            technique used in Data Science, which is used to split observed
            variance data into various components for additional analysis and
            tests. This module will teach you how to identify the significant
            differences between the means of two or more groups.
          </p>

          <h5>Regression Analysis</h5>
          <p>
            Regression Analysis is a statistical technique used to analyse the
            relationship between a dependent variable and one or more
            independent variables. In this module, you will learn several
            variations like linear regression, multiple linear, and non-linear
            regression.
          </p>
          <h5>Dimension Reduction Techniques</h5>
          <p>
            Dimension Reduction transforms data from a high dimensional to low
            dimensional space without losing any vital information. This module
            will teach you how to work with various Dimension Reduction
            techniques in Machine Learning.
